After **4...exd4 5.Nxd4 Nxd4 6.Qxd4**, the position is equal. Alternatively, **4...Bb6** keeps more tension but is slightly passive.

Any pawn advance creates weaknesses\n\n**Key principles:**\n- **Don't rush pawn moves** - They create weaknesses\n- **Improve your king** - Kf1-e2-d3-c4 might try to invade\n- **Watch for zugzwang** - Force opponent to weaken\n\nRecommendation: This should be a **draw** with best play. You can try **Kf1** maneuvering to the queenside, but Black mirrors. The position is too symmetrical for either side to win. In such positions, often a draw is agreed.
